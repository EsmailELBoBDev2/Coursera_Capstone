    "McDonald's has good amout of branches already (according to **[HERE](http://i.imgur.com/UAr44Oy.png)**) but who does not love to expand and earning more money? so in this report, i tried my best to gather ideas and data to give you the full or at least the almost full image to pick our next place. so i did my analytics using the here we go maps API and mapped around 30 locations! and i noticed a very weird pattern, that us and our competitors dod, got a multi branches and its numbers do not get higher than 3 branches, i don't know why yet but it's good, as you can see **[HERE](https://i.imgur.com/IKv88NC.png)**, and same applys about our competitors (*KFC*) as you can see it **[HERE](https://i.imgur.com/iqCRGPI.png)**. So i had that idea weird idea that it's about sending a message that it's our place, we got 3 branches go somewhere. so according to my data and analytics, it's gonaa be good idea to open more branches in places that we are already opened to send the same message to them. so i would say our next place to open a bransh that any city that got less than 3 branches as it showed **[HERE](https://i.imgur.com/1qYtD8e.png)** and **[HERE](https://i.imgur.com/GxbDDCC.png)** (*red = McDonald's, yellow = KFC*)"
