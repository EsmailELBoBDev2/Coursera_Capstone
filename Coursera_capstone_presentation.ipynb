    "McDonald's has good amout of branches (according to **[HERE](http://i.imgur.com/UAr44Oy.png)**) but who does not love expanding and earning more money? not me for sure haha so in this report, i tried my best to gather ideas and data to give you the full or almost the full image. so i did my analytics using the here we go maps and mapped around 30 location for my PC specs sake! and i noticed a VERY weird pattern, that us and our competitors got multi branches and its numbers do not get higher than 3 numbers, i don't know why but that's what the data telling me, as you can see **[HERE](https://i.imgur.com/IKv88NC.png)**, and same apply about our competitors (*KFC, evil laugh*) as you can see it **[HERE](https://i.imgur.com/iqCRGPI.png)**. So i had that idea it's like way to tell like fuck off you know? like hey we got in this city 3 branches, go to somewhere else and to be honest with you it's bad idea to compete with competitor big and famous like KFC for example! so according to my data and analytics, it's gonaa be good idea to open more branches in place that we are already opened to send the same message to our competitors to stop them from expanding in our places, near from our branches. so i would say our next place to open a bransh that any city that got less than 3 branches as it showed **[HERE](https://i.imgur.com/1qYtD8e.png)** and **[HERE](https://i.imgur.com/GxbDDCC.png)** (*red = McDonald's, yellow = KFC*)"
